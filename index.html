        <h2>Console Web App</h2>

        <p> In Visual studio code there three different types of coding, html, css, and javascript.
            Html is the "skeleton" of the code because you use it to add all the base features of the code.
            Javascript is the "movement" of the code because you use it to add the the code of buttons.
            Css is the "clothes" of the code because you use it to add all the color to the code. 
        </p>

        <p>The console screen is something that you can use to test if your code is working properly or you could write in it too.</p>
